# **Structural Dynamics Tools**

*A MATLAB toolbox for response analysis, vibration mode computation, and numerical integration in structural dynamics.*

---

## **1. Overview**

This repository contains a set of MATLAB scripts developed for the study and analysis of structural dynamics, focusing on single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) systems and simplified multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) approximations. The tools implement classical and numerically robust procedures commonly used in earthquake engineering, modal analysis, and structural vibration research.

The repository is designed for researchers, graduate students, and practitioners who require transparent, reproducible implementations of:

* Duhamel’s integral for SDOF response
* Newmark-β numerical integration
* Response spectrum generation
* Rayleigh and Rayleigh–Stodola mode-shape estimation
* Mass-orthogonal multi-mode extraction

All scripts are accompanied by theoretical documentation in LaTeX format.

## **2. Included MATLAB Tools**

### **2.1 Duhamel Integration Methods**

* **`duhamel_simpson_flex.m`**
  Computes the time-history response of an SDOF system using Simpson’s rule for evaluating Duhamel’s integral. Supports mixed unit systems and force/acceleration excitation.

* **`duhamel_response_spectrum.m`**
  Computes displacement, velocity, and acceleration response spectra directly from the Duhamel integral for a user-defined period range.

---

### **2.2 Newmark-β Integration**

* **`newmark_beta_response_spectrum.m`**
  Implements the general Newmark-β method using:
  [
  v_{t+\Delta t},; \dot{v}*{t+\Delta t},; \ddot{v}*{t+\Delta t}
  ]
  Based on arbitrary β and γ parameters (default: average-acceleration method).
  Generates response spectra from numerical integration of the equation of motion.

---

### **2.3 Mode Shape Computation**

* **`rayleigh_modes.m`**
  Computes natural mode shapes using:

  * Classical Rayleigh iteration for the first mode
  * Generalized Rayleigh–Stodola procedure for higher modes
  * Mass-weighted Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization:
    [
    \phi_i^T M \phi_j = 0, \quad i \neq j
    ]
    Produces final converged mode shapes side-by-side for interpretability.

## **3. Documentation**

Extensive theoretical explanations, derivations, and worked examples are included in the **`docs/`** directory:

* Rayleigh Method
* Orthogonalization and higher-mode extraction
* Newmark-β theory (general β and γ)
* Duhamel integral theory and numerical evaluation
* Worked examples illustrating algorithmic steps

These documents are provided in LaTeX format for academic use, adaptation, and inclusion in theses.

## **5. Research Motivation**

The tools in this repository are motivated by frequent academic needs in structural dynamics research:

* Generating high-resolution response spectra for parametric studies
* Verifying analytical expressions using numerical integration
* Exploring mode shapes in simplified MDOF systems
* Developing teaching material for graduate dynamics and earthquake engineering courses
* Conducting preliminary studies prior to finite element modeling

The scripts prioritize transparency and clarity over optimization, making them suitable for both education and reproducible research workflows.

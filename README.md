Structural Dynamics Tools

A collection of MATLAB scripts for structural dynamics analysis, including Duhamel integration, Newmark-β response spectrum, Rayleigh–Stodola mode shape estimation, multi-mode orthogonalization, and other custom numerical tools for research and engineering applications.

This repository is intended for academic and research use, with appropriate citation required (see Citation section below).

📘 Overview

This repository contains numerical solvers and utilities that allow engineers, researchers, and students to:

Compute SDOF time-history response using the Duhamel Integral

Generate response spectra using both

Simpson-integration Duhamel method

Newmark-β averaged acceleration method

Determine mode shapes using

Classical Rayleigh method

Multi-mode Rayleigh–Stodola with mass orthogonalization

Work with dynamic loading, force records, and ground-acceleration records

Produce clear plots and exportable data for reports, theses, and publications

All scripts are documented and accompanied by LaTeX README files within /docs.
